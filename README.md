# ModuleSystem++
ModuleSystem++ is designed as replacement for the module system compiler provided by Taleworlds, providing drastically improved performance and advanced features potentially useful in Warband mod development.

ModuleSystem++ is very easy to try. You don't have to make any changes to your module system file - just copy the ModuleSystemPlusPlus.exe file to your module system (they don't overwrite anything) and you're good to go! 

ModuleSystem++ requires Python version 3.3+! Unlike vanilla compiler, it will not be able to run on Python 2.x versions.

ModuleSystem++ features:
1) Compilation speed is several times higher than vanilla compiler and W.R.E.C.K
2) Obtaining a list of resources used in the module
3) Obfuscation names of scripts and global variables
